- New columns

 ## DATA CLEANING

Using the Get data Tab, I imported each file using the **Text/CSV** option and loading each based on the entire dataset.
I loaded the files into Power Query editor for cleaning. I Renamed column headings, I checked for missing values, duplicates,
nulls, empty cells and Changed data types for each column.
  
### To ensure the integrity of the data I checked the following;

- Column quality
- Column distribution
- Column profile

The quality, distribution and profile all came back 100% valid, no error and empty cells. Cleaned thoroghly except for the 
"Shipped table" column in the "Order" table which showed twenty one null values, these null values were filled down
( Table.FillDown(#"Replaced Errors",{"Shipped Date"}) to ensure accuracy in the analysis.

Two new columns were also created for the analysis

- Total Revenue (Total Revenue = order_details[Unit Price] * order_details[Quantity].

## CONCLUSION

This study sought to investigate three questions as they relate best reaching these goals:
What are the Top 7 Products in terms of Revenue?, The monthly trends? and Total Revenue 
generated by each Shipping Company?, It is important to determine whether there is a 
threshold at which a loss of revenue can be justified by the effects being generated.
They can increase the number of shipping company in the hopes of buying more products to generate more revenue.
In doing so, they would also have an opportunity for future analysis of data gathered after the fact 
for before-and-after comparisons.
